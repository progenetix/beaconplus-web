### cancer genome data @ progenetix.org

The Progenetix database provides an overview of copy number abnormalities in human cancer from currently **113322** array and chromosomal [Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization) experiments, as well as Whole Genome or Whole Exome Sequencing (WGS, WES) studies. The cancer profile data in Progenetix was curated from **1600** articles and represents **420** and **542** different cancer types, according to the International classification of Diseases in Oncology (ICD-O) and NCIt "neoplasm" classification, respectively.

Additionally, the website attempts to identify and present all publications (currently **3962** articles), referring to cancer genome profiling experiments.The database & software are developed by the [group of Michael Baudis](http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/baudis/) at the [University of Zurich](http://www.uzh.ch).
