The Progenetix database provides an overview of mutation data in cancer, with a focus on
copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA), for all types of human malignancies.

#### Data Content and Provenance

The resource currently contains genome profiles of **113322** individual experiments. The
genomic profiling data was derived from array and chromosomal
[Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization)
experiments as well as Whole Genome or Whole Exome Sequencing (WGS, WES) studies. Genomic profiles
are either processed from various raw data formats or are extracted from published experimental
results.

Besides genomic profiling data, Progenetix contains sample specific biological, technical and provenance
information which so far has been curated from **1600** articles.

Original diagnoses are mapped to (hierarchical) classification systems and represents **420** and **542**
different cancer types, according to the International classification of Diseases in Oncology (ICD-O) and NCIt "neoplasm" classification,
respectively.

<ExampleHistogram/>

For exploration of the resource it is suggested to either start with [Cancer Types](/subsets/list)
or by [searching](/samples/search) for CNVs genes of interest.

Additionally to genome profiles and associated metadata, the website present information about
publications (currently **<PublicationCount/>** articles) referring to cancer genome profiling experiments.

#### Access, Maintenance and Contributions

The content of the progenetix resource is freely accessible for research and commercial purposes, with
attribution.

The database & software are developed by the [group of Michael Baudis](https://info.baudisgroup.org)
at the [University of Zurich](https://www.mls.uzh.ch/en/research/baudis/) and
the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics [SIB](http://sib.swiss/baudis-michael/).

Many previous members and external collaborators have contributed to data content and resource features.
Participation (features, data, comments) by volunteers are welcome.
