### About Beacon<sup>+</sup>

This forward looking Beacon interface implements additional, planned
features beyond the current Beacon specifications.

The Beacon<sup>+</sup> genome variation service tests experimental
features and proposed extensions to the [Beacon](http://beacon-project.io) protocol.
The service is implemented using the [bycon](https://github.com/progenetix/bycon)
backend and allows access to the various datasets represented through the
[Progenetix](http://progenetix.org) cancer genomics resource.

Further information about the Beacon project can be found through the
[ELIXIR Beacon website](http://beacon-project.io/).
