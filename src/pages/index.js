          The Progenetix database provides an overview of mutation data in
          cancer, with a focus on copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA), for all
          types of human malignancies.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Content and Provenance</h4>
        <p>
          The resource currently contains genome profiles of{" "}
          <strong>113322</strong> individual experiments. The genomic profiling
          data was derived from array and chromosomal{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization">
            Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)
          </a>{" "}
          experiments as well as Whole Genome or Whole Exome Sequencing (WGS,
          WES) studies. Genomic profiles are either processed from various raw
          data formats or are extracted from published experimental results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides genomic profiling data, Progenetix contains sample specific
          biological, technical and provenance information which so far has been
          curated from <strong>1600</strong> articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Original diagnoses are mapped to (hierarchical) classification systems
          and represents <strong>420</strong> and <strong>542</strong> different
          cancer types, according to the International classification of
          Diseases in Oncology (ICD-O) and NCIt &quot;neoplasm&quot;
          classification, respectively.
        </p>

          For exploration of the resource it is suggested to either start with{" "}
          <a href="/subsets/list">Cancer Types</a> or by{" "}
          <a href="/samples/search">searching</a> for CNVs genes of interest.

        <p>
          Additionally to genome profiles and associated metadata, the website
          present information about publications (currently{" "}
          <strong>{publications}</strong> articles) referring to cancer genome
          profiling experiments.
