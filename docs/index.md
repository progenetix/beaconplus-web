# BeaconPlus - Beacon Front-end for Genomic Data Querfies

![Beacon Icon](http://info.progenetix.org/assets/img/logo_beacon.png){ align=right width=25px}The Beacon protocol defines an open standard for genomics data discovery,
developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health. Since 2016,
the Beacon protocols is being developed through the
<a href="https://beacon-project.io">ELIXIR Beacon project</a> as a GA4GH driver project.</p>

As part of the project, since early 2016 the [Theoretical Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics Group](http://info.baudisgroup.org) at the University of Zurich develops the
[Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> demonstrator](https://beacon.progenetix.org/ui/),
to show current functionality and test future Beacon protocol extensions.

The Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> implementation is a
custom front end on top of the [Progenetix](http://progenetix.org)
dataset, with emphasis on structural genome variations from cancer samples.
